# Predicting traffic accidents severity by Machine Learning
___
### Introduction
Traffic accidents severity can be predicted based on previous accidents. From the given example data set of traffic accidents, we can build a model that predict 
future accidents' severity. This will help drivers make their decision to reduce accidents.

### Data
Data we used is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/tbsteal/canadian-car-accidents-19942014?select=drivingLegend.pdf (Open database License). This data describes Canadian Car Accidents 1994-2014
with details. Accidents severity ranging from 1-10, accompanied by 21 attributes that accurately describes the particular cases. Data and meta data are in the repo.
